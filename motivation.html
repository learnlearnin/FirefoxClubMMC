    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p>Some of us have always felt that MMC students could use some extra skills in using the web, adopting new technology as they come, using computers, etc. Some of us know a few things about computers that are very easy to learn but very impressive once you know. We have always felt like sharing these, but not one to one (that'd be too much strain on everyone, you see). You know what they tell about <strong>knowledge, when you share it, it grows</strong>.</p>
 
    <p>Also, Akshay is volunteering for Mozilla. It is a global community of people who work for a better, open, free Web. And like any big organization Mozilla has a program through which it spreads its mission and roots to colleges all over the world - Firefox Student Ambassadors Program. So Akshay signed up to be an FSA recently, and one of the first things FSAs naturally do is to form a Firefox Club in their college. So he asked people to join.</p>

    <p>Thus, this club was formed</p>

    <p>Now what this group should mean, do, stand for, etc, is totally up to the members. In the coming days we must be able to decide what our focus should be on, and proceed on doing at least a handful of things that'll be useful for us and the world.</p>
